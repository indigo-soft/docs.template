# AGENTS Guide

## What this repository is

This is a **documentation and tooling template** for software projects.
It provides a ready-to-use structure for: commit conventions, release flow, git hooks,
documentation guides, ADR/AIR/AID/RFC processes, AI-assisted onboarding prompts, and project memory.

The goal: clone this repo, run the onboarding prompt, and have a new project with consistent
conventions and documentation from day one — without writing 20 documents from scratch.

> Use `npm run` for release commands (not `pnpm run`) to avoid ELIFECYCLE noise.

## Global tools required

Due to pnpm's isolated linker behavior on WSL2, the following tools must be installed
globally via npm. They are NOT in `devDependencies` — installing them locally via pnpm
produces text redirect files instead of real symlinks, which Node.js cannot resolve
in git hook subprocess context.

```bash
npm install -g commitlint @commitlint/cli @commitlint/config-conventional
npm install -g release-it @release-it/conventional-changelog
npm install -g prettier markdownlint-cli2
```

> ⚠️ This is a WSL2 + pnpm v11 specific workaround. On native Linux or macOS with pnpm,
> local installation may work correctly.

## `.pnpmrc`

The project root contains `.pnpmrc` with `approve-builds=lefthook`.
This suppresses pnpm's interactive approval prompt for lefthook's `postinstall` script
on every fresh `pnpm install`.

> ⚠️ Use `.pnpmrc`, not `.npmrc` — `approve-builds` is pnpm-specific and causes
> npm warnings if placed in `.npmrc`.

## Conventions agents must follow

- **Formatting:** respect `.editorconfig` globally — UTF-8, LF endings, final newline,
  trailing whitespace trimmed, 4-space indent (2-space for shell and JSON files), max 120 chars/line.
- **Commit format:** `<type>(<scope>): <description>` — scope is required, type must be from
  the allowed list in `commitlint.config.mjs`.
- **Branch format:** `<type>/<issue-number>-<description>` — issue number is required,
  minimum 4 digits (e.g. `feature/0001-setup-docs`).
- **Documentation lives in `docs/`** — do not create documentation files in the project root.
- **Prompts live in `docs/prompts/`** — one file per document type, English only.
- **Context files are append-only** — never delete or rewrite existing entries in `decisions.md`.
- **Checklists are updated after work** — mark items done in `docs/checklists/new-project.md`
  after completing the corresponding task.
- **AID documents capture AI work** — after a significant AI interaction, create an AID in `docs/aid/`.
- **Glossary maintenance** — when adding new concepts, process types, document types, or tooling
  to the project, check `docs/glossary/glossary.md` and add any terms that are not yet defined.
  New terms go under the correct alphabetical section using a `###` heading.
- **Glossary linking in READMEs** — in every `README.md` file (root and within `docs/`),
  link the **first occurrence** of each term that is defined in `docs/glossary/glossary.md`.
  Use the format `[term](docs/glossary/glossary.md#term-anchor)` (adjust relative path as needed).
  Subsequent occurrences of the same term in the same file do not need a link.

## Tooling and workflows

- **Lefthook** manages git hooks — configured in `lefthook.yml`:
  - `pre-commit`: formats staged files with Prettier, lints markdown with markdownlint
  - `commit-msg`: runs commitlint to validate message format
  - `pre-push`: runs `lint:check` + `format:check`
- **commitlint** validates commit messages and branch names — config in `commitlint.config.mjs`.
- **release-it** handles versioning and changelog — config in `.release-it.json`.
- **markdownlint-cli2** lints all markdown files — config in `.markdownlint.jsonc`.
- **Prettier** formats all files — config in `.prettierrc`.

## Architecture and integration notes

- This repo has no runtime application — it is a template, not a service.
- `src/` is a placeholder for when this template is used as a base for an app repo.
- No database, no API, no external service integrations in this repo itself.

## Agent operating guidance

**DO:**

- Read `docs/context/project.md` at the start of any session involving a real project built from this template.
- Append to `docs/context/decisions.md` after making any non-obvious choice.
- Update `docs/checklists/new-project.md` after completing a task.
- Use prompts in `docs/prompts/` as the source of truth for how to generate each document type.
- Ask for the project's onboarding context before generating any project-specific document.
- Install global tools (see above) before running git hooks or release scripts.
- Create an AID in `docs/aid/` after any significant AI interaction.
- Check `docs/glossary/glossary.md` when adding new content — add any missing terms before committing.
- Link the first occurrence of every glossary term in each README file you create or edit.

**DO NOT:**

- Rewrite or delete existing entries in `docs/context/decisions.md`.
- Create documentation files outside of `docs/`.
- Modify `pnpm-lock.yaml` manually.
- Invent commit scopes — use only the scopes defined in `commitlint.config.mjs`.
- Add commitlint, release-it, or prettier to `devDependencies` — they must be global.
- Run `pnpm setup` to install hooks — use `pnpm run init` instead.
- Put pnpm-specific config in `.npmrc` — use `.pnpmrc` instead.
- Confuse AIR (ADR conflicts) with AID (AI interactions) — they are different document types.
- Add a term to a README without first checking if it belongs in `docs/glossary/glossary.md`.
