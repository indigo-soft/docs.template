# Release Flow Guide

Releases are managed via [`release-it`](https://github.com/release-it/release-it) with the
[`@release-it/conventional-changelog`](https://github.com/release-it/conventional-changelog) plugin,
wrapped in a custom pre-release check script.

## What happens on each release

1. Pre-release checks run (clean working directory, correct branch, commits pushed, lockfile exists).
2. `release-it` determines the version bump from commit types (`feat` → minor, `fix` → patch, `feat!` → major).
3. `package.json` version is updated.
4. `CHANGELOG.md` is updated automatically from commit history.
5. A release commit is created: `chore(release): vX.Y.Z`.
6. A Git tag `vX.Y.Z` is created and pushed.
7. A GitHub Release is published with auto-generated notes.

## Prerequisites

| Tool         | How to install                                                 |
| ------------ | -------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `node` ≥ 24  | [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org) or nvm                        |
| `pnpm` ≥ 10  | `npm install -g pnpm`                                          |
| `git`        | any recent version                                             |
| `release-it` | `npm install -g release-it @release-it/conventional-changelog` |

> ⚠️ `release-it` must be installed **globally** — not as a local pnpm dependency.
> See `AGENTS.md → Global tools required` for the full explanation.

A `GITHUB_TOKEN` with **repo** scope is required for GitHub Releases:

```dotenv
# .env
GITHUB_TOKEN=ghp_xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
```

## Release Commands

> **⚠️ Use `npm run`, not `pnpm run`** to avoid `ELIFECYCLE` noise on non-zero exit codes.

| Command                 | Description                                                             |
| ----------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `npm run release:dry`   | Preview only — runs checks and shows what would happen, no changes made |
| `npm run release:patch` | Bump patch version (`X.Y.Z+1`) — bug fixes                              |
| `npm run release:minor` | Bump minor version (`X.Y+1.0`) — new features                           |
| `npm run release:major` | Bump major version (`X+1.0.0`) — breaking changes                       |
| `npm run release`       | Interactive — `release-it` prompts for version choice                   |

## Typical Workflow

```text
1. Merge all feature branches → main (via Pull Request)
2. Ensure CHANGELOG.md is not empty and all commits are pushed
3. npm run release:dry       ← verify everything looks correct
4. npm run release:patch     ← (or :minor / :major)
5. Verify the new tag and GitHub Release on GitHub
```

## Conventional Commits → Version Bump

| Commit type                 | CHANGELOG section           | Bump    |
| --------------------------- | --------------------------- | ------- |
| `feat`                      | ✨ Features                 | `minor` |
| `fix`                       | 🐛 Bug Fixes                | `patch` |
| `perf`                      | ⚡ Performance Improvements | `patch` |
| `revert`                    | ⏪ Reverts                  | `patch` |
| `docs`                      | 📚 Documentation            | —       |
| `chore`                     | 🔧 Miscellaneous Chores     | —       |
| `feat!` / `BREAKING CHANGE` | 💥 Breaking Changes         | `major` |

## Pre-Release Checks

The script validates the following before any release starts:

| #   | Check                   | What it verifies                           |
| --- | ----------------------- | ------------------------------------------ |
| 1   | Dependencies            | `git`, `node`, `pnpm` are installed        |
| 2   | Clean working directory | No unstaged or staged changes              |
| 3   | Correct branch          | You are on `main` or `master`              |
| 4   | Commits pushed          | No local commits ahead of `origin`         |
| 5   | Lockfile exists         | `pnpm-lock.yaml` is present                |
| 6   | CHANGELOG exists        | `CHANGELOG.md` is present and non-empty    |
| 7   | GITHUB_TOKEN            | Set, well-formed, and valid via GitHub API |

If any check fails, the script exits with a descriptive error. No changes are made.

## CHANGELOG

`CHANGELOG.md` is generated and updated **automatically** by `@release-it/conventional-changelog`.

> ⚠️ Do **not** edit `CHANGELOG.md` manually — it will be overwritten on the next release.

## Configuration Files

| File                         | Purpose                                      |

| `scripts/release/release.sh` | Main release entry-point                     |
| `scripts/release/checks.sh`  | Pre-release check functions                  |

| `GITHUB_TOKEN not set`          | Missing env var            | Add to `.env` or export in shell                               |
| `release-it: command not found` | Not installed globally     | `npm install -g release-it @release-it/conventional-changelog` |

## Future: GitHub Actions automation

When ready to automate releases via CI, add a workflow file:

```yaml
# .github/workflows/release.yml
name: Release
on:
  push:
    branches: [main]
jobs:
  release:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v6
        with:
          fetch-depth: 0
      - uses: pnpm/action-setup@v4
        with:
          version: '10'
      - uses: actions/setup-node@v6
        with:
          node-version: '24'
          cache: 'pnpm'
      - run: pnpm install --frozen-lockfile
      - run: npm install -g release-it @release-it/conventional-changelog
      - run: release-it --ci
        env:
          GITHUB_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
```
